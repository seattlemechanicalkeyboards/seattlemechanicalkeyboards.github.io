<h2>Get ready for the 2nd semi-annual <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23smkmeetup&src=typd">#smkmeetup</a></h2>
  <p>Over 100 people have RSVPed to the event and a large majority of you are bringing keyboards. There will be keyboards in all shapes and sizes. If you're looking to try out something new, it is likely to be at this event. So come early and stay until close because there will be plenty of people to meet and plenty of keyboards to see.</p>

    <h3>LCM Loan Forms</h3>
    <p>If you fail to fill out the loan form, please leave your keyboards at home.</p>

  <p><em>If you have already submitted your form (thank you!), then your name is on the list for free admission. When you arrive at the museum, check in at the front desk.</em></p>
  <p>If you plan to bring one or more keyboards, you <strong>must</strong> fill out the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Zd76tVDOrYYjdmNExLLVpJZzQ/view">Living Computers Loan Form</a>, print it, and bring it with you to the event. <strong>However, you cannot enter the building with keyboards until your form has been hand delivered to the front desk.</strong></p>
  <p>This means that you will need to leave your keyboards in your car while you walk your forms inside. Alternative ideas are to come with a friend and have them deliver the form while you wait outside with keyboards, or message someone already inside to come out to take your form. These requirements are at the request of Living Computers given their liability responsibilities. Please be respectful; <strong>friends don't let friends bring keyboards into the museum without proper documentation.</strong></p>

  <h3>Parking</h3>
  <p>The Living Computer Museum has limited parking available in their parking lot. Street parking should be free. There are plenty of paid parking options as well.</p>
  <p>However, we just found out that a <strong>Seahawks playoff game will also be taking place this Saturday at 5:30pm</strong>. Parking may be a challenge. Public transportation or carpooling is recommended.</p>

  <a href="http://en.parkopedia.com/parking/locations/living_computers:_museum_+_labs_1st_avenue_south_seattle_wa_united_states_c23n8nns4mq/?arriving=201701071400&leaving=201701071700" class="button special fit">Show me parking options</a>

  <h3>Public Transportation</h3>

  <p>According to the Living Computers website:</p>

  <blockquote>The primary bus routes near Living Computers: Museum + Labs are 21, 594, 132, 106, 50, 102, 590, and 116. You can also use the Metro Transit Trip Planner to find a bus route.

  <p>You may also find suggestions for Seahawks games useful, however you will be a few blocks away from the museum if you follow Century Link Field directions completely.</p>
